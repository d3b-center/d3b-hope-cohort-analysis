```

1) data-availability: This module has scripts to create data availability plots.
2) merge-files: This module has scripts to merge files obtained from cavatica i.e. RSEM gene expression, Consensus MAF, ControlFREEC, Fusions which are then filtered and annotated. 
3) msi-sensor-analysis: Downstream analyses with MSISensor pro outputs.
4) oncoplots: This module has scripts to create oncoplots and cascade plots. Reference files and genelists were obtained from https://github.com/d3b-center/d3b-pnoc003-HGG-DMG-omics/tree/master/analyses/Oncoplot.
5) survival-analysis: This module has scripts to do survival analysis with ALT status and molecular subtypes.
6) alt-analysis: Downstream analyses with ALT status.
